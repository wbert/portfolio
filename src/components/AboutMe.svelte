  <p class=" leading-relaxed">
    Hi, I’m Wilbert Josh Alfornon — a software engineer specializing in web
    development, data science, and machine learning. I build clean, efficient
    web tools that turn complex data into clear, actionable insights — helping
    teams save time, reduce errors, and make smarter decisions.
  </p>
  <p class=" leading-relaxed">
    One of my recent projects involved developing a full system for a yearbook
    publishing office: automating data collection, managing solicitations, and
    scheduling pictorials — streamlining their workflow from start to finish.
  </p>
  <p class=" leading-relaxed">
    I’m always exploring emerging technologies to keep my projects innovative
    and future-ready. If you're looking to streamline your next project, let’s
    connect!
